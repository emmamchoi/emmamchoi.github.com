        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The project is a collection of tea places I frequent, utilizing the knowledge I've accumulated in HTMl/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p><a href="https://cannesprlions.com/en/lionsnews/">This</a> site utilizes a side-scroll through of images to display multiple pages.I think this is much beyond my own capabilities, but is a very enaging site. I think some basics could be feasible, like some scroll interaction, but overall it is very refined. I think the controls are a little unclear initially, as I didn't realize you could scroll the mouse wheel to control it as well. I would like to incorporate some side scroll collection but we'll see if I can.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p><a href="https://santar.webflow.io/">This</a> site has some really simple (on the surface) but interesting interaction elements. Again, a lot of it I think is a bit beyond my skills, but the interaction of the site with the user is more interpersonal. I probably will use text more than audio, but I like the site. Perhaps there could be more variety in this site, but I also speak from a point of not having much variety myself, soo..</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>In relation to the comparison projects, my own project will be much simpler. The elements related would likely be only vaguely similar, encapsulating more of a similar idea than being just like the studies. Additionally, I might make adjustments along the way if I can't figure things out as I imagine them, so we shall see.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>Working off my baseline, I will probably keep a relatively monochrome color scheme (now it is a blue). Since the logos I am using have a variety of colors, I figure the other colors present should be relatively tame, so there isn't too much going on. I place a figure in the center to be a kind of focal point, and the rest of the information falls around it. A slideshow/bar of images for choices is relatively typical/intuative, and works fine placed at the bottom of the screen, I believe. I also kept some symmetry with the text boxes on both sides. However, if I were to implement a text box that looks like a speech bubble (a suggestion from critiques before), I might then change both style-wise, or change the layout.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>I might consider some more movement/animations to incorporate (eg. rather than the figure in the middle being the same/stationary, there could be animations to switch through different poses). The scroll bar is interactive, and there is a bit of narrative interaction between the viewer and the text.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>I hope to make a relatively simple but engaging experience. I don't want to overload information on the page, but I want to have enough to provide the user with something to read. </p>
