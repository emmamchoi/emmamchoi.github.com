        <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
        <p>Overall, the navigation through the site seemed to be relatively intuative to most people. There isn't too much going on, so I don't think it's too overwhelming or anything. One point brought up is that the focal point is kind of the bottom bar, so your eye is drawn there first. The instructions, on a side bar, is not as in focus, which may be something you want to see first.</p>
        <p>Some mentioned the navigation bar could have a smoother scroll effect, since my current implementation is very simple, with no smooth transitions, and has 3 locations. Smoother transitions could also be applied to hover actions.</p>
        <p>Some suggestions for info included are links to the place, location, my drink order, and something indicating the current place you are on (aside from the side text, eg. a title or something). Additionally, the readability of the text could be improved with a greater line height.</p>

        <h2>Planned Changes</h2>
        <p>Given that this is submitted after the deadline (oops), I've already implemented a smoother nav scroll. I will add transitions to the hover states as well, so that overall the experience is less jumpy. Additionallly, I think that I will add something to the arrows around the bar (a hover, or mouse change, etc.) to add to interactivity.</p>
        <p>In terms of info, some of it was on my "to add" list already, so I will add that (location, order, website). I will also look into formatting the text nicer.</p>
