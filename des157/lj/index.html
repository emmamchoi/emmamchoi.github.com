            <p>There were some things in this article that made sense, but I wouldn't have necessarily thought of myself. For example, number 5 mentions marking optional inputs rather than marking the mandatory fields. I've mostly seen the asterisks denoting mandatory info input, but that usually requires more fields to be marked than marking the optional one. I guess this could be an example of how design patterns change/improve over time.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I thought the "never use a reset or clear button" tip was interesting. My first reaction was wondering how bad having a reset/clear button would be, and that having it wouldn't be a bad thing. However, the more I thought about it, the more I could see why they say "this button almost never helps users, but often hurts them." In most general/practical situations I could think of (eg. filling out a form), a reset button would indeed be unnecessary. However, I could see different circumstances where one might want to use a reset button (eg. something marketed for replayability or the like).</p>
